# FixAdobeAppsPanel

Command-line scripts to fix 'You Don't Have Access To Manage Apps' in the Creative Cloud app.

To use these scripts, your user account needs administrative privileges. 

If you are on a company computer that is managed by an IT department, you might be unable to use these scripts, and you'll need to ask for help.

## Download links and instructions

### For Mac:

First, download:

https://zwettemaan.github.io/FixAdobeAppsPanel/FixAdobeAppsPanel.command

If you want to make sure, first open the file in a text editor and inspect it - it's fairly straightforward code.

Then open a Terminal window, and paste the following three commands (assuming your browser is configured to download to the `~/Downloads` folder)
```
cd ~/Downloads
chmod +x FixAdobeAppsPanel.command
./FixAdobeAppsPanel.command
```
Enter your user password when asked, followed by the <Return> key

The Adobe Creative Cloud app should open, hopefully with the Apps panel re-instated

### For Windows:

First, download:

https://zwettemaan.github.io/FixAdobeAppsPanel/FixAdobeAppsPanel.bat

If you want to make sure, first open the file in a text editor and inspect it - it's fairly straightforward code.
